        <p>The Pirate Bay is the worlds largest bittorrent indexer...</p>
        <p>The Pirate Bay is the worlds largest bittorrent indexer. Bittorrent is a filesharing protocol that in a
            reliable way enables big and fast file transfers.</p>
        <p>No torrent files are saved at the server. That means no copyrighted and/or illegal material are stored by
            us. It is therefore not possible to hold the people behind The Pirate Bay responsible for the material
            that is being spread using the site.</p>
        <p>The Pirate Bay was started by the swedish anti copyright organization <a href="#">Piratbyrån</a> in the
            late 2003, but in October 2004 it separated became run by dedicated individuals. In 2006 the site
            changed it's ownership yet again. Today the site is run by an organisation rather than individuals,
            though as a non-profit. The organisation is registered in the Seychelles and can be contacted using the
            contact form.</p>
        <p>Using the site is free of charge for individuals however there are some restrictions. Please see the <a
